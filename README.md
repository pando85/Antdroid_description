## About AntDroid

AntDroid is a fully open source hexapod robot. Its totally parametric design allows you to assemble any hardware you like.

The software is divided in two parts: the firmware and servo control is done by an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/ "Arduino") Mega and the top level control is done by [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/ "Raspbery Pi") running [ROS](http://www.ros.org "ROS").

AntDroid limits are only in your imagination.
